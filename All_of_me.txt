What would I do
Without your smart mouth drawing me in
And you kicking me out
I got my head spinning
No kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

Because all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
Because I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my Rhythm & Blues
I can't stop singing
It's ringing in my head for you

My head's underwater
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

Because all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
Because I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
Give me all of you

Cards on the table
We're both showing hearts
Risking it all though it's hard

Because all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
Because I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
